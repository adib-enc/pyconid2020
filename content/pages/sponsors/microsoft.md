# 2. #Microsoft #Azure and Python

Microsoft and PyCon have had a strong relationship globally for years. This year, especially, there were also online [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2020/sponsors/virtualexpohall/) on last May, and [PyCon APAC 2020](https://pycon.my/pycon-apac-2020-conference-talks/) organized by **PyCon Malaysia** with Microsoft sponsorship ([Link 1](https://www.facebook.com/mymsftdev/posts/3202382903148635), [Link 2](https://www.facebook.com/mymsftdev/videos/1244405782573677/), [Link 3](https://www.facebook.com/mymsftdev/posts/3217745064945752)). Microsoft has worked with Python communities to create tools and services which provide ease of development.

Invent with purpose: Empower your inner inventor to turn ideas into outcomes with Microsoft Azure. Python is great to build and deploy your applications, and further to apply empowering AI & data science functionalities. At PyCon US 2020 which happened online in last May, Microsoft shared the improvements we‚Äôve made for Python developers in Azure, especially our newer offerings that enable you to build and deploy Python applications in the cloud at any scale. You can check out the details of Microsoft's presentations at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/boards/pycon2020.aspx.
Also, read about what Microsoft loves about PyCon and the Python community on the ["Microsoft‚Äôs Python team loves PyCon, including this year‚Äôs online version!"](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/04/microsofts-python-team-loves-pycon.html) article, which is really cool!

# 3. More resources

More various content for Python users is available at Microsoft [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/id-id/) and [Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/id-id/learn/).

* [Azure for Python Developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/id-id/azure/developer/python/): Deploy your Python code to Azure for web apps, serverless apps, containers, and machine learning models. 
Take advantage of the Azure libraries (SDK) for Python to programmatically access the full range of Azure services including storage, databases, pre-built AI capabilities, and much more.
* [Build an AI web app by using Python and Flask](https://docs.microsoft.com/id-id/learn/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/): Use Python, Flask, and Azure Cognitive Services to build a web app that incorporates AI.
* [Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging](https://gloveboxes.github.io/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/) tutorial and a sponsor session were done at PyCon Korea 2019 last year, and [Python + AI GitHub repo content](https://github.com/apacdevpmmresources/NewZealand/tree/master/Python-AI) was presented at PyCon Kiwi last year - those are also great resources with Azure and Python.
